#Capqi Demo Code
Demo used to show the PHP library and the widget of the CAPQI project

This is an example of what the Widget and the [PHP Library of CAPQI](https://github.com/esn-org/capqiApi-library) can do.

You can check [here a live version of this demo](http://ares.esn.org/~gorkaguerrero/capqidemo/)

If you want to test by yourself, you need to have an username, password and id in the website TransparencyAtWork and edit the file `config.php` with them
